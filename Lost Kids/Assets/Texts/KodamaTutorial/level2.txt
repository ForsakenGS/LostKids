Hmm... Here already? That means it went very good, better than what I expected, actually. Moreover, you're accompanied by a girl, Akai... Maybe united you have higher probabilities of escaping from here, but you'll need great teamwork. The first thing is to be used to change the control from one to the other: key 1 for Aoi and key 2 for Akai.
For this task, you have to cooperate. I hope you don't need me to say how, right? Play with levers and character control and see how fun it is!
Akai, it's time to show your potential. Use your "break" ability to destroy that wall so you can continue your way.
Akai, your turn again, but this time for using your "push" ability with that rock over there. As I see you're so smart, I'm not telling you what to do after. Just be careful on your way and take care of your heads. See you soon!
