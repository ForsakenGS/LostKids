<kodama> Hello again! Let me introduce your new very best friend, Akai! As you can see, she has a cool mask too, GENUINE Kodama manufacture hehe. Why dont you let her show you her skills? Use -2- to select her, and -1- to get control back. See you!
<kodama> Now its time to see Akai's INCREDIBLE strength. Remember how to use abilities? Show us how you BREAK through that wall. Easy job, right? He he...
<kodama> YAY! You did it! You are LITTLE step closer now. But Akai can't just DESTROY things, right? You can also move very very heavy objects. Quite useful skill, isn't it? Use it to find a way to the next room!
