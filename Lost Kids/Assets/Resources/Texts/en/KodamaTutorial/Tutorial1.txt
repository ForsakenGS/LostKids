<kodama> Uhm... already here? Do you enjoy your new mask? Well, I need to make sure that you are prepared before going any further. Find me in the next room to start the trials!
<kodama> Your first trial... The mask that I gave to you not only makes you look AWESOME, but it also increases your skills! Press -Ability1- to use your new Great Jump Ability and find me in the next room once you are familiar with it!
<kodama> WOA! Did you see how high you can jump!? INCREDIBLE!! Now you gotta be fast, very fast... Use -Ability2- to use your Sprint Ability and go trough the door in time. Good luck!
