<kodama> You reached the last trial... more dangerous and deadly that you could imagine... Just joking! HAHAHA, Gotcha! Im sorry Ki. Oh, by the way, this is Ki. Your new best friend. He is very shy, but you will get on very well, as you will need to cooperate to survive... hee hee...
<kodama> Hey Ki! Show your new friends your MAJESTIC intelligence! Did you guys know that he can move things with his mind? Well, maybe his mask, PERSONALLY made by ME, can help a little... Try to find an use for that big brain!
<kodama> Here you are, A+ for Ki, HOORAY!! Have you ever felt like your mind was out of your body? Yes, just like a dream! Can you imagine doing it while inside a dream?? And again?? Well stop there, we can't go that far, this is not a movie. But only the SMARTEST can project their mind and reach places where their body couldn't, like going through walls!
<tanuki> Can you bring a shot of delicious sake? I will be so grateful...
<tanuki> Thank you very much, kid!
