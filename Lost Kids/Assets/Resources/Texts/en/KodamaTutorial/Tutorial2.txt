<kodama> Hello again! Let me introduce you to your new best friend, Akai! As you can see, she has a cool mask too, GENUINE Kodama manufacture hee hee. Why don't you let her show you her skills? Use -R1- to select her, and -L1- to control Aoi again. See you!
<kodama> Now it's time to see Akai's INCREDIBLE strength. Remember how to use abilities? Show us how you BREAK through that wall. Easy job, right? Hee hee...
<kodama> YAY! You made it! You are a LITTLE step closer now. But Akai can't just DESTROY things, right? You can also move extremely heavy objects. Quite a useful skill, isn't it? Use it to find a way to the next room!
<kodama> Don't try to leave your friend behind!. You'll have to cooperate later.
<kodama> OH! that hurts. In this nightmare you could die, but your souls just go to the latest active Tori arch so that you reclaim them there. Just give it a try!
